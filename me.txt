I'm bliz8. A competetive <a href = "https://shellshock.io">Shell Shockers</a> "everyday" player and a programmer, neccessarily in JavaScript and a bit of Python... and just a splash of HTML! <br/><br/> I have some projects such as creating public discord bots by the name of Verdant and Leaflet in discord.js, as well as starting up a YouTube Channel for Content. Note that this website really doesn't count as a project, since it was taken by RaidTheWeb (<a href = "https://raidtheweb.ml/">Here is the link to his site</a>) <br/></br/>
